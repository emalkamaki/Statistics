Dimension reduction techniques:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Reduces dimensions to its principal components. The reduced dimensions are not directly interpretable and does not learn topics.
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for non-negative array of values. The model is interpretable and works well for word frequency, audio and images. For example: find similar articles or artists
